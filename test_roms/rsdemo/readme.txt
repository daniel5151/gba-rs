Rotation/Scaling Demo (RSdemo)

NOTE: the gba rom is RSdemo.bin

This little utility lets the user change the values for the Rotation and scaling registers, and then see the results on the LCD.  Not only is the Background rotated and scaled, The values for the registers are displayed also.

The keys are all shown in the scrollie on the bottom, but I will also define them here.

L by itself:  Stops the scrolling text
R by itself:  Speeds up the scrolling text
L & R together without pressing other keys:  Restarts the scroller

Up, Down, Left, and Right change the BGX and BGY values

Holding A and pressing L or R changes the DX value
Holding B and pressing L or R changes the DY value
Holding Start and pressing L or R changes the DMX value
Holding Select and pressing L or R changes the DMY value

Have fun!
